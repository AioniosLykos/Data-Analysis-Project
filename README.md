# Data-Analysis-Project
Analysis on a public data set: 
Nutritional values, including Calories and Micro-nutrients from six of the largest and most popular fast food restaurants:
McDonald's
Burger King
Wendy's
Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)
Taco Bell
Pizza Hut

-The dataset used in this analysis is taken from 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/fast-food/data

-Analysis is going to be made based on some known facts:
*Protein is 4 calories per gram.
*Fat is 9 calories per gram.
*Carbohydrates are 4 calories per gram.
*Fiber is 2 calories per gram.
*Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the human body can't digest, therefore it should not be included in the calorie intake of a person. 
*Aerobic activities include: Walking,Jogging,Running,Hiking,Bicycling,Swimming,Jumping rope,Dancing,Stair climbing,Rowing,Playing sports
*Anaerobic activities include: Weightlifting, Jumping or jumping rope,Sprinting,High-intensity interval training (HIIT),Biking (High intensity)

-Every individual's diet looks different. Some might have dietary restrictions that can not be analysized in this project. I only aim to answer the following question; 
*How do we make better choices when it comes to fast food?

-I will answer the previous question given an activity category and fat,protein,carbohydrates percentages of a followed diet plan of an individual. 

-As said above, individual differences will not be taken into consideration such as age, height, weight, fitness goal(gaining or losing weight). 

*I will use a calorie budget for a cheat meal (upper limit)
*ex: a person who has a calorie budget of 700 cal for a cheat meal, what (where is implied) should they choose to eat?
*This budget can be set depending on the person's goals and situation.

-To make this inclusive of different type of people(men, women, old, young) and their goals(losing body fat, gaining body fat, maintaining), I will analyze everything depending on different calorie budget groups when creating my report. 

Note that some values of certain items are changed since this data has been collected. (I verified (: )
