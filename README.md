# Data-Analysis-Project
**Overview**

Analysis on a public dataset: Nutritional values, including Calories and Micro-nutrients from six of the largest and most popular fast food restaurants:

-McDonald's

-Burger King

-Wendy's

-Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)

-Taco Bell

-Pizza Hut

		

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this analysis is taken from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/fast-food/data)



**Analysis Assumptions**

-Protein is 4 calories per gram.

-Fat is 9 calories per gram.

-Carbohydrates are 4 calories per gram.

-Fiber is 2 calories per gram.

-Fiber, being a type of carbohydrate that the human body can't digest, should not be included in the calorie intake.



**Objective**

Every individual's diet looks different. Some might have dietary restrictions that cannot be analyzed in this project. The aim is to answer the following question:

-**How do we make _better choices_ when it comes to fast food?**



**Methodology**

-Answer the above question given the fat, protein, and carbohydrate percentages of an individual's diet plan.

-Individual differences such as age, height, weight, and fitness goals (gaining or losing weight) are not considered.

-Use a calorie budget for a cheat meal (upper limit).

Example: For a person with a calorie budget of 700 calories for a cheat meal, what (where is implied) should they choose to eat?

This budget can be set depending on the person's goals and situation.

-Analyze different calorie budget groups to make this inclusive of different types of people (men, women, old, young) and their goals (losing body fat, gaining body fat, maintaining).



**Note**

Some values of certain items may have changed since this data was collected. These changes have been verified.
